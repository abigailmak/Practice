This is a GitHub repository. This will be where you "turn in" your code.

It's essentially a place where we can both see what your coding. That way I can check if your
doing everything correctly and you can practice workflow and good code coverage.

Code coverage is a way to measure how much of a code base is tested. Just like how word documents have an auto save feature, it's important to save your code along the way.
