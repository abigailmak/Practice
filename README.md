This is a GitHub repository. This will be where you "turn in" your code.

It's essentially a place where we can both see what your coding. That way I can check if your
doing everything correctly and you can practice workflow and good code coverage.

Code coverage is a way to measure how much of a code base is tested. Just like how word documents have an auto save feature, it's important to save your code along the way.
It's typically good to keep an 80% code coverage.

Code Coverage Percentage = 
(Number of lines of code executed)/(Total Number of lines of code in an application) * 100

We can worry about calculating code coverage after you learn to code :)

The first thing I'm going to be teaching you is how to manipulate a terminal. Every computer has a terminal. A terminal is a text-based interface that allows users to interact with a computer by entering commands and viewing the results.
